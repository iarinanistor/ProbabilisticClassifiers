# Agricultural Simulation
This project aimed to develop a data-driven system that optimizes crop rotation planning and resource allocation. 
## Files Overview

- **Python files (`.py`)**: These contain the core functions and algorithms for data processing and analysis.
- **Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`)**: These notebooks allow you to interactively run the code, explore the dataset, and view results and visualizations.
## How to Test the Code

1. **Download or clone the repository**:

2. **Install required dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn).  You can install them using:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib networkx scikit-learn statsmodels csv seaborn scipy time
3. **Navigate to the Jupyter notebooks:**
    Open the .ipynb files in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
4. **Run the notebook cells:**
    Inside the Jupyter notebook, run the cells sequentially by clicking on the play/run button or pressing Shift + Enter. This will execute the Python code in the notebook and display the results.

5. **View the results:**
    After running the notebook, you will see the analysis results and visualizations generated from the pre-defined dataset.
